Download Raspbian at the following location :
[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

Burn the downloaded image to your microSD card.
If you are on Linux or MacOS and if you are a command line person, you could use the dd command.

You can find a perfect explanation of the process [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

Personnaly, I love [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) which is an application to burn images on SD cards.
As Etcher is based on the Electron framework, it works perfectly on Linux, MacOS or Windows.

I highly recommend to download this program as you are going to use it a lot starting playing with the Raspberry Pi.
